# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic game 'Rock Paper Scissors'.

## Project Overview

The primary goal was to solidify foundational concepts of JavaScript logic, including conditionals and functions in a practical application.

## Key Features:

* Play a 5-round game against a computer opponent.
* Random computer choice generation.
* Score tracking and final winner declaration.

## Core Skills Practiced:

* Core JavaScript Logic (Variables, Conditionals, Operators)
* Function Structure & Separation of Concerns
* Interacting with the DOM (via prompt/console)
* Test-Driven Problem Solving
* Professional Git/GitHub Workflow

## What I Learned:

This project was a deep dive into structuring a complete application from the ground up. I moved beyond simple scripts to create a system of interconnected functions, which solidified my understanding of:
* **Functional Architecture:** The importance of separating concerns by creating small, single-responsibility functions (e.g., one for the computer's choice, one for the player's choice, one for the game's rules). This made the code more organized and easier to debug.
* **Data Flow and Return Values:** A major focus was understanding how to use return to pass data out of a function and into another to be used for decision-making. This was key to making the scoring system work.
* **Input Control:** I learned how to make the player input case-insensitive, a crucial step in creating a robust user experience.
* **Game Loop Logic:** I implemented the 5-round game logic first manually, and then refactored it using a for loop, which was a powerful lesson in automation and the DRY principle.
